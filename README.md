 # Asynchronous Programming in .NET 8.0

This repository provides practical examples and explanations of asynchronous programming concepts in .NET 8.0.

## Key Concepts

* **Asynchronous Programming:** Executing operations concurrently to improve application responsiveness and performance.
* **Async and Await Keywords:** Simplifying asynchronous programming by making it look synchronous.
* **Task and Task<TResult>:** Representing asynchronous operations and their results.
* **Parallel Programming:** Executing multiple tasks simultaneously to leverage multi-core processors.
